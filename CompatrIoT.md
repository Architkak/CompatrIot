<h1>CompatrIoT</h1>

<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

The CompartIoT Security learning kit is a great way to get started with IoT device security and exploitation using the DIVA (Damn Insecure and Vulnerable Application) board and other targets. This kit includes everything that you need in your arsenal to perform UART, I2C, SPI, JTAG, WiFi, BLE analysis. These labs provide guidance and step by step process of performing each lab. It will teach you everything from finding the communication ports, sniffing, manipulating communication to exploiting IoT devices.

<h2>PROTOCOLS</h2>


<h4> - UART </h4>

<p>Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter
    
<p>The best things about UART is that it only uses two wires to transmit data between devices
<p>
    
<h4> - JTAG </h4>

<p>JTAG is named after the Joint Test Action Group which codified it.

<p>
    
<p>
    
<h4> - I2C </h4>

<p>Inter-Integrated Circuit

<p>

<h4> - SPI </h4>

<p> Serial Peripheral Interface

<h5> - UART </h5>

<h5>Identification Method 1</h5>
                    
<p>If we know about the microcontroler we can simply use Digital Multimeter conductivity test to identify UART pinouts on the PCB board provided we have the knowledge of microcontroller UART pins, which can be found in the datasheet of the microcontroller.

<h5>Identification Method 2</h5>
                    
<p>If we are not able to identify the microcontroller , then using Digital Multimeter we will do some Voltage tests on the board pinouts. This will help us to identify UART pinouts on the PCB board when we do not have the knowledge of the microcontrollerand its UART pins 

<h5>Identification Method 3</h5>
                    
<p> Once we sucessfully identified the UART pins we can communicate with the device to access the device using usb to TTL converter. 

    
<h5> - JTAG </h5>

<h5>Identification Method 1</h5>
                    
<p>JTAG Debug port identification method 1 using micro-controller pins and DMM (Digital Multimeter) conductivity test. The objective is to identify JTAG pinouts on the PCB board provided we have the knowledge of microcontroller JTAG pins, which can be found in the datasheet of the microcontroller.
